Nola was molested by her cousin, uncle, and a family friend, starting when she was nine years old. When Nola discussed the alleged abuse with family members at age 24, they refused to accept what she said. Nola chose never to be a mother because she had not been mothered well. At 13, Nola ran away from home. When she was 14, she became pregnant but her son was born prematurely and he died shortly after birth. She began going to Lincoln High School; but after early success in the Upward Bound program, was transferred to the affluent suburban Nicolet High School, where her poverty was constantly rubbed in her face as she rode the bus to school with fellow African-Americans, some of whom were servants of her classmates' families. She began to steal money from her mother in an effort to keep up with her free-spending peers, to lie to and argue with her mother, and to go out with older boys.
